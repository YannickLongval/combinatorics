# combinatorics
Applying the concepts I learned in my **MAT344: Introduction to Cominatorics** class to create various programs related to combinatorics. An overview of each program is provided below.

# graphs/kruskalsAlgo.py
Kruskal's algorithm is used to find the minimal weight spanning tree of a connected, undirected, weighted graph (this project assumes the graph is connected). More about the algorithm can be found here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm)
<br/>
This program implements Kruskal's, and visualizes the graph with the spanning tree.
